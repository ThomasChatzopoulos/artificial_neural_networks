# Artificial Neural Networks

This is an academic project for the course of *Computational Intelligence* concerning Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Deep Learning.

The aim of this project is to develop and train an ANN that takes a user as input and will generate ratings for all movies in the data set at the output. 

For more details about the requirements of the project and the results of the ANN training you can check the files in the folder *requirements_&_report*.
